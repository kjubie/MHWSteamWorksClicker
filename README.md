# MHWSteamWorksClicker

Automated button presser for MMHW Steamworks.

## Starting
Start the main.py and press 'page_up' key to start pressing 'w', 'a' and 's' keys in random order.

## Pause/Resume
Press 'page_down' key to pause the program.
To resume press 'page_up' key again.

## Stopping
Press 'end' key to end the program.

## Requirements
- Python (of course)

## Upcoming Changes
Currently the program does not account for the palicos that tell you what you need to press.
I am working on capturing the screen and telling if the palicos are active or not.
If they are active the program should then be able to recognize the correct button and press it.
